**Megascene** is a term used to refer to an amalgam of San Francisco's cultural scenes - particularly those that are adjacent to the technology industry.

## Composition

San Francisco's Megascene is estimated to be composed of about 5,000 people - many of whom are involved in group housing to some degree, and all of whom are at most two degrees of social connection away from any other member. Social connections are largely mediated by Twitter, or through group housing residency in SF.

Specific groups thought to at least partially overlap with the Megascene include:

- Rationality
- Effective Altruism
- YIMBY
- Stanford/Berkeley Academia
- Burning Man
- Effective Accelerationism
