**Megascene** is a term used to refer to an amalgam of San Francisco's socio-cultural scenes - particularly those that are adjacent to the technology industry.

Due to significant social overlap, its composite scenes are often referred to as one; increasingly, via the metonym 'Hayes Valley.'

## Composition

San Francisco's Megascene is estimated to be composed of about 5,000 people.

It is an unusually dense social graph; despite its size, each member is thought to be at most two degrees of social connection away from any other member.

### Cultural wings

The Megascene's composite scenes are loosely grouped into four "wings":

- **North Wing**: Rationality, Effective Altruism, and AI safety/research
- **West Wing**: Startups, engineering, and "hacker culture"
- **South Wing**: Burning Man, spirituality, and psychedelics
- **East Wing**: Philosophy, history, literature, and the "neo-intelligentsia"

## Social dynamics

San Francisco's Megascene persists on both physical and digital substrates. Largely, this involves [group house](/group-housing) residency and events, as well as Twitter (dominant in the West and East wings) and Facebook (dominant in the North and South wings).

### Notable spaces

A large constellation of group houses and other private spaces are frequented by members. Most of these cater to specific cultural wings:

- [Lighthaven](/lighthaven) - North Wing
- [Lyceum](/lyceum) - East Wing
- The Alembic - South Wing
- The Center - South Wing
- The Commons - Mixed
