## Composition and culture

As of September 2024, it houses 10 people - most of whom have been affiliated with MIT in some capacity.

Residents of LxM are pursuing a variety of engineering projects - including BCIs, cryptography, and mechanistic interpretability. Artistic expression also has an abundant presence in the house, with poetry and other crafts visible throughout.

The house's culture places an explicit emphasis on _mischief_.
