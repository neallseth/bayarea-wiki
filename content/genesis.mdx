**Genesis** was a [group housing](/group-housing) community in the Lower Haight neighborhood of San Francisco.

Genesis was composed of two buildings, known as the 'White House' and 'Blue House' (also known as 'Big Blue'), with 33 bedrooms total.[^1]

The community remained active from 2018 until the group's eviction in spring of 2023. By early 2024, the houses had become occupied by an unnamed group of MIT alumni and startup founders in YCombinator's S24 batch.

## Background

The buildings used by Genesis are known to have been used for group housing as early as 2004.
