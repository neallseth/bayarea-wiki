**Lyceum** (or Neethaus) is a [group house](/group-housing) in the Twin Peaks neighborhood of San Francisco.

## Background

Lyceum was founded in late summer 2024 by Twitter user _@PrinceVogel_[^1], filling a years-old void of physical spaces catering to the burgeoning "East Wing" of the Bay Area's [Megascene](/megascene).

It aims to be a home for discourse on philosophy, literature, history, and the arts.
