**Solaris** was the name of both a co-living network in Lower Haight, and a workspace in North Mission (SolarisAI). Both were organized by the same party.

## Co-living

The Solaris housing network was most active during the SF's [Layoff Rennaissance](/key-eras).

It was composed of four main houses (along with a handful of satellite units), clustered around Haight & Steiner:

- Sol
- Helios
- Ra
- Luminance

As of spring 2025, the four houses largely remain inhabited by its original occupants and their immediate friends, though the cultural prominence of the community has dwindled alongside its event schedule.

During its active period, Solaris was known for hosting weekly dinner parties, pitch competitions, and hackathons.

## Workspace

The SolarisAI workspace was formerly located on the third and fourth floors of 1680 Mission St.

SolarisAI was active through all of 2024, and during this period became known for its steady clip of high quality events geared toward AI startups and engineers. These events, combined with the space's talent density, made it the de facto home of SF's AI scene.

SolarisAI was preceded by Newton, located at 1929 Market St. Its community quickly outgrew the space, leading to the migration a few blocks away to the larger SolarisAI office space
