### Contribution guide

To add an article, simply create a new MDX file under `/content`. The filename will become the article's slug.

Metadata is stored in [frontmatter](https://mdxjs.com/guides/frontmatter/) format - the only required field is `title`, but `category` is also recommended for organization purposes. From there, it's just standard [MDX](https://mdxjs.com)!

Images can be added under `/public/images/your-article-name`. Include the image in your article using the `<ImageCard/>` component

_Caveat emptor: this project is very much subject to the curation and personal opinion of its [benevolent dictator](https://neall.org)._
